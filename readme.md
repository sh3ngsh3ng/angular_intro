# Angular
- Framework used to build client side applications
- Modular Approach
    - Every feature is a separate module
    - Modules are reusable
- Quick & Easy development
- Unit testable
- Semantic Versioning
    - major.minor.patch
    - major change = break nay functionality
    - minor = added feature
    - patch = updates/bug fix
    - E.g. 7.2.11
- Module = Services + Components
    - Components = HTML & classes
    - Services
- Template 
    - view, html
- Class
    - code, typescript, data & fucntions/methods
- Metadata
    - @Component
- Property Binding
    - Property vs attribute
    - Attributes are not going to change
    - Attributes are always defined by html
    - Properties are always defined by the DOM
    - Attributes initialize the DOM properties
- Multiple styles
    - Using ngClass
- Directives
    - Predefined meaning by angular
- Structural Directives
    - Remove HTML elements
    - ngIf, ngFor, ngSwitch
- Data Flow
    - Component to template = property binding??
    - Template to component = event binding??
- Dependency injection
    - As a design patter = dependencies not created in same class, constructor???
    - as a framework
        - create and write a Service Class
        - Service Class should be registered with the Injector
        - Write/declare the dependency
- Forms
    - Data Binding
    - Change Tracking
    - Validation
    - Visual Feedbacks
    - Error Messages
    - Form submissions
    - Data Flow = Template (collects data) -> Class (bind data) -> Service (send data) -> server
    - Types of forms
        - Template Driven Forms
            - Hard to perform unit testing with template driven forms
            - If a lot of validation, template driven form not good
        - Reactive Forms
