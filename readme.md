# Angular
- Framework used to build client side applications
- Modular Approach
    - Every feature is a separate module
    - Modules are reusable
- Quick & Easy development
- Unit testable
- Semantic Versioning
    - major.minor.patch
    - major change = break nay functionality
    - minor = added feature
    - patch = updates/bug fix
    - E.g. 7.2.11
- Module = Services + Components
    - Components = HTML & classes
    - Services
- Template 
    - view, html
- Class
    - code, typescript, data & fucntions/methods
- Metadata
    - @Component
- Property Binding
    - Property vs attribute
    - Attributes are not going to change
    - Attributes are always defined by html
    - Properties are always defined by the DOM
    - Attributes initialize the DOM properties
- Multiple styles
    - Using ngClass
- Directives
    - Predefined meaning by angular
- Structural Directives
    - Remove HTML elements
    - ngIf, ngFor, ngSwitch
- Data Flow
    -
